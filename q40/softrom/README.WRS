This has a patched version of SOFTROM that loads at 57600 bps.

The changes were made using the 'bvi' editor.

The only code change is adjusting the value programmed into the UART divisor
register from 0x000C (9600bps) to 0x0002 (57600bps).  I also tested 0x0001
(115200bps) but this resulted in data underruns, failure and disappointment.

A few text strings were also changed so the difference is obvious to the user.
